# Used Car Price Prediction Application

## Overview

This project is a Python Flask and React application that utilizes a machine learning model to predict used car prices. The model, built using Random Forest Regression, has achieved an RÂ² score of 0.87. The application can parse through a dataset of used vehicles, automatically train the model with predefined configurations, and implement the learned model into the backend. The React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for entering car details and obtaining price predictions.

## Features

- **Automated Model Training**: The application can automatically train the model using a dataset of used vehicles.
- **Price Prediction**: Users can input car details through the frontend and receive a predicted price from the backend.
- **Visualization**: The result page displays various graphs including a linear graph of predictions based on mileage, correlation graphs, and a price range histogram.
